Electronic Shelf Labels (ESLs) are steadily replacing traditional paper Labels in common use scenarios. / becoming more popular / more widely used

To ensure long lasting operation, ESLs rely on power efficient wireless communication.
To archieve usable lifetime durations, ESLs rely on low power wireless protocols.
In this Theseis two different types of such protocols, namely Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and LoRa are examined.

The usage of smart in office devices has risen considearabyain the last years.
This is mostly due to the wider availabilty to, cheaper, smaller, and more efficinet hardware.
A prime example of such a device is the smart Office Label.
The advantages of digitalising labels are paramount, as they remove the need to physically access the label on every change and provide the possibility for further automation.
To be viable as a replacement for traditional labels, smart office labels still have to satisfy some requirements, such as ease of use, cost efficiency and long battery runtime.
To maximise runtime, the device has to minimise power consumtion and therefore relies on low power displays and networking protocols.
In this thesis two of such protocols, namely LoRa and Bluetooth low energy (BLE) are examined.
